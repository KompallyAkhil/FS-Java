// Liam is a textile artist creating a patchwork quilt. He has X types of uniquely 
// sized fabric patches. Each patch has a specific number of design squares on it. 
// Liam wants to create a perfect square pattern on the quilt using these patches. 
// He can use any number of patches of each type.

// However, there are some square counts that he cannot achieve with these patches. 
// Your task is to help Liam figure out the maximum number of design squares that 
// cannot be formed using any combination of the available patch types.

// Note: The number of design squares on any two different patches is co-prime.

// Input Format:
// -------------
// input1: An integer X representing the number of different patch types available.
// input2: An integer array representing the number of design squares each patch type contains.

// Output Fromat:
// --------------
// Return an integer value representing the maximum number of design squares that 
// cannot be created on the quilt using the given patch types.

// Sample Input:
// -------------
// 2
// 3 5

// Sample Output:
// --------------
// 7

// Explanation:
// ------------
// Using patches with 3 and 5 design squares, the largest number of design squares 
// that cannot be formed by any combination is 7.


// Sample Input:
// -------------
// 4
// 3 7 17 29

// Sample Output:
// --------------
// 11
