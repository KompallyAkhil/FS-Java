/*
You are given a set of releases of a software and you are asked to find the most
recent release. There may be multiple checkins of the software in a given branch. 
Each branch may also have sub branches. For example release 3-5-4 refers to the 
fourth checkin in the fifth sub branch of the third main branch. 
This hierarchy can go upto any number of levels. 

If a level is missing it is considered as level 0 in that hierarchy. 
For example 3-5-7 is  same as 3-5-7-0 or even same as 3-5-7-0-0. 
The higher numbers denote more recent releases. 

For example 3-5-7-1 is more recent than 3-5-7 but less recent than 3-6.
